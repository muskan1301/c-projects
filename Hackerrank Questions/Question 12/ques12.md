In this example, you will learn to evaluate the size of each variable using sizeof operator.
In this program, 4 variables intType, floatType, doubleType and charType are declared.
Then, the size of each variable is computed using the sizeof operator.

### Input Format

Nothing

### Constraints

Nothing

### Output Format
```
Size of int: 4 bytes Size of float: 4 bytes Size of double: 8 bytes Size of char: 1 byte
```
### Sample Output 0
```
Size of int: 4 bytes
Size of float: 4 bytes
Size of double: 8 bytes
Size of char: 1 byte
```
